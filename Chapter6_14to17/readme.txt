6.14 (Floor and Ceil) Write two methods myFloor and myCeil that take a positive double num
variable int myFloor(double num) and int myCeil(double num).
The myFloor method takes num and returns the largest integer number that is less than or equal to x.
The myCeil function takes num and finds the smallest number that is greater than or equal to x. Do
not use any Math class methods. Incorporate this method into an application that sends a double
value to the functions and tests their ability to calculate the required output.
6.15 (Hypotenuse Calculations) Define a method hypotenuse that calculates the hypotenuse of
a right triangle when the lengths of the other two sides are given. The method should take two arguments
of type double and return the hypotenuse as a double. Incorporate this method into an
application that reads values for side1 and side2 and performs the calculation with the hypotenuse
method. Use Math methods pow and sqrt to determine the length of the hypotenuse for each of the
triangles in Fig. 6.14. [Note: Class Math also provides method hypot to perform this calculation.]
6.16 (Multiples) Write a method isMultiple that determines, for a pair of integers, whether the
second integer is a multiple of the first. The method should take two integer arguments and return
true if the second is a multiple of the first and false otherwise. [Hint: Use the remainder operator.]
Incorporate this method into an application that inputs a series of pairs of integers (one pair at a
time) and determines whether the second value in each pair is a multiple of the first.
6.17 (Divisible by 5) Write a method isDivisible that uses the remainder operator (%) to determine
whether ten input integers are divisible by 5 or not. The method should take an integer argument
and return true if the integer is divisible by 5 and false otherwise. Incorporate this method
into an application that inputs a sequence of integers (one at a time) and determines the result.
